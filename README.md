My Process: When I originally started my project, I wanted to do a multiplayer real-time animated game online (like agar.io) however figuring out how to smoothly animate the frames synchronously to each individual client proved to be quite the moonshot for a 3-4 day project. After being already 2 days in with the project and not seeing a near end to the project, I decided to change pace and try a different idea. And that idea is Word Frenzy! A multiplayer speed-typing game, each player receives a mix of random words and the first player to finish typing all the given words wins!

I still hope to finish my first project idea sometime in the near future however.

NodeJS, Javascript/JQuery, HTML and CSS (tiny bit of bootstrap) were used to create this project.

I used https://www.wordnik.com API for generating random words from the dictionary.
